## Deployment Methods

Choose one:

### Method 1: Manual Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Then drag and drop build folder to Netlify UI
```

### Method 2: Netlify CLI
```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Method 3: Git Integration (Automatic)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Netlify"
git push origin main
# Netlify deploys automatically
```

## Quick Deploy Command

```bash
# Build and deploy via CLI
npm run build && netlify deploy --prod

# Or if using Git
git add . && git commit -m "Update" && git push origin main
```

## Success!

Once deployed:
- Site URL: `https://[your-site-name].netlify.app`
- All routes accessible
- Wallet functioning correctly
- Ready to share!

**Pro Tip**: Set up branch deploys for testing changes before production:
1. Create a `dev` or `staging` branch
2. Netlify will create preview URLs for each branch
3. Test thoroughly before merging to `main`
